// ❓ DESCRIPTION:
// Timmy is trying to determine if his team, team 1, has won a game, but his reduce function is causing him some problems!

// Each team has an array/list of up to three integers, representing the scores they received. A team may have fewer than three scores.

// Team 1 wins if the sum of its scores is greater than the sum of team 2's scores.

// Return true if team 1 wins or false otherwise!

// ❗ Solutions

function calculateTotal(team1, team2) {
  let t1s = team1.reduce((t, c) => t + c,0);
  let t2s = team2.reduce((t, c) => t + c,0);
  return t1s > t2s;
}
